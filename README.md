FizzBuzz with Autumn, Kabiru, and Collins

## My Summary of Assignment - A Lazy User Story
Here is my summary of the FizzBuzz instructions on lines 113-128 in Program.cs (I'll copy Kabiru on this):

- The app asks the user to enter a number.
- The app will then print every number from 1 to whatever the user entered, EXCEPT
    - If the number is divisible by 3, it prints 'fizz' instead OR
    - If the number is divisible by 5, it prints 'buzz' instead OR
    - If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, it prints 'fizzbuzz' instead
